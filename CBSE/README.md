LaTeX (pronounced <b> "LAY-tech" </b> or <b> "LAH-tech" </b>) is not a programming language per se but a typesetting system commonly used for the production of technical and scientific documents. 
It is based on the TeX typesetting system, which was developed by Donald Knuth. 
LaTeX provides a set of macros and commands that simplify the process of formatting and typesetting documents, especially those containing complex mathematical equations, scientific notations, and references.

## Here are key points about LaTeX:

    Typesetting Documents: LaTeX excels at typesetting high-quality documents, particularly those with mathematical and scientific content. It is widely used in academia, research, and publishing for the production of articles, reports, theses, and books.

    Markup Language: LaTeX documents are written using a markup language, where the content is described with plain text along with markup commands. Users focus on the content structure, and LaTeX takes care of formatting, making it particularly useful for large and complex documents.

    Cross-Platform Compatibility: LaTeX documents are plain text and can be edited with any text editor. LaTeX distributions are available for various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.
