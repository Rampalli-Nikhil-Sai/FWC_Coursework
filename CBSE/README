LaTeX (pronounced "LAY-tech" or "LAH-tech") is not a programming language per se but a typesetting system commonly used for the production of technical and scientific documents. 
It is based on the TeX typesetting system, which was developed by Donald Knuth. 
LaTeX provides a set of macros and commands that simplify the process of formatting and typesetting documents, especially those containing complex mathematical equations, scientific notations, and references.
