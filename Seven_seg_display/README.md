# 7-Segment Display and State Machine
## 7-Segment Display:
1) A 7-segment display is an electronic display device with seven LED segments arranged in the shape of the number "8." Each segment can be independently controlled to represent numeric digits (0-9) and some letters.
2) By selectively illuminating the segments, different characters can be displayed.
3) It is commonly used in devices like digital clocks and calculators for numeric representation.
