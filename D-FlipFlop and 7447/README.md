# FlipFlop Definition:
Flip-flops are digital circuits that store binary information, typically representing a 0 or a 1. They are fundamental building blocks in digital electronics and are used for memory storage, sequential logic, and synchronization. Flip-flops play a crucial role in the design of digital circuits, such as registers, memory units, and sequential logic elements in microprocessors.
