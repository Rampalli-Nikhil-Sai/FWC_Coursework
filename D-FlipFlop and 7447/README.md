# Flip-Flop Definition:
Flip-flops are digital circuits that store binary information, typically representing a 0 or a 1. They are fundamental building blocks in digital electronics and are used for memory storage, sequential logic, and synchronization. Flip-flops play a crucial role in the design of digital circuits, such as registers, memory units, and sequential logic elements in microprocessors.
## Okay too tough !! Made simpler
Imagine you have a tiny electronic switch that can be in one of two states: ON or OFF. This switch is like a digital memory cell, and we call it a flip-flop.<br>

Now, this flip-flop can remember if it's turned ON or OFF. You can tell it to change its state (from ON to OFF or vice versa) by giving it a special signal called a "clock." When the clock signal changes, the flip-flop either turns ON or OFF, depending on certain rules.<br>
### There are many types of Flip-Flops, but the one given here is a D-FlipFlop
